I have been playing this game for the last 2 days and just completed it, plus all the side quests and every achievement.

The Good
----------

Overall - It is a very charming game. Lots to do, good amount of play time for the money and lots of variety in terms of mini games, quests and areas to discover. Also it is pretty funny in places (I laughed a few times), has many unique characters and lots of little cute pop culture references and quirky aspects - like the changing pictures each day based on time travel movies and passing references to TV shows like The Wire

Main Story - The main story took me about 4-5 hours to complete, and the game kind of guides you through it so it is not extremely difficult. I liked this aspect because otherwise I might get lost walking around all the time, There is also a full walkthrough guide posted in the community for the game page for if you get stuck. I did not use it for the main story but I did for 2-3 of the side quests. The story evolves in quite a fun an unexpected direction involving time travel, espionage and quantum physics.

Side Quests - The side quests are varied and there are about 30 of them. You have to do about half to complete the game, some are easy some are hard. All are different and match the characters personality who gives them to you.

Battles - The battle system is more like a puzzle mode on a small grid where you use weapons is certain order to kill enemies. At first I was unsure but after doing 1-2 of them and getting used to it I did really enjoy them.

Graphics - Reminds me of SNES type retro but with a lot of detail, definitely very cohesive and adds to the atmosphere and ambience.

Sound - One of my favorite things, the sound really good. Fits the game and has lots of variety and ambience.

The Bad
---------

Overall - overall there is not too much bad to say, I really liked this game. It is not an action game but it has all the elements you would expect of a casual RPG, and done well. If anything bad could be said overall it is just to improve the little aspects listed below to give an overall polish to the whole game.

Main Story - The main story is quite linear, it could perhaps have 2 endings, but then that would be a different game.

Side Quests - Some side quests are not clear what to do and I had to turn to the guide for 2-3 of them in order to complete every one. I didn't personally mind this, but some might find it too hard and perhaps there could be a couple more clues for the harder side quests from the dog sidekick or in from other NPCs. I emailed the developer about this and a couple of small bugs, and he said he is going to make some of the side quests clearer and improve the continuity, so by the time you read this it might be a non-issue. He also fixed the small bugs very quickly and pushed a patch within 1 day, so that was encouraging.

Battles - A couple of them were quite hard. Again, I turned to the guide. A couple were also insanely easy. I guess it is good to have a variety of levels but 2 of them were REALLY hard, at least for me. The guide gave me the answer I needed to get past them though.

Graphics - A couple of the animation are a little hokey, but aside from that I have no qualms with the art.

Sound - Nothing bad to say.

Summary

I loved this game, if you like games like Stardew Valley and story RPGs with comedy this is one of the best you will find.
yeah nice game and easter egg . but hard
A friend of mine recommended this game to me due to the hidden Bitcoin in it, so I decided to try it. Overall, I love the pace of the game and the quirky storyline and all the hidden secrets and pop culture references. It's definitely a chill, casual kind of game with wide variety of side quests and things to do. The story is heart-warming and honestly I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed the characters and the dialog. It is obvious a lot of effort went into this and it shines through in the many little details. I still have a ways to go but so far I am really enjoying it.
This game has been so much fun. Very reminiscent of classic RPG's that we all grew up with. I love the mystery, all the puzzles and police adventures, the story line was great and cute music soundtracks.

The developer has even put it on sale, you really cannot go wrong with this purchase. Also check out the NFT's available. One of a kind :)
Been playing this game nonstop for over an hour now and it is fantastic! The funny dialogue, witty humor, amazing music and artwork are such joys to experience and the unique story is very gripping! I took a short break to help spread the word on it but cannot wait to jump back in and continue the story. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a little mystery and comedy wrapped in one package!
I love how this game combines nostalgia and quirkiness into a hilarious, sweet story. The dialogue options are absolutely hilarious, and the mini games are easy to understand but also the perfect challenge!
Fun game with a real indie vibe - tones of Stardew Valley, and plenty of humor. There is a lot to do, and it gives me that warm, fuzzy feel of Stardew and retro SNES games.
Beautiful nostalgic retro RPG game with charm and character.
I'm sad to give this a negative review. I like the strange setting, the story, and the quests. But the combat system is so frustrating as to be completely unplayable. If you fail a combat, it lets you retry... and I've retried many combats 20 or 30 times over. It's just exasperating.",,,,,
